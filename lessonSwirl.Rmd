This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Data Upload

- to upload data frame in .csv use the following function and assign to a new variables. There are many other ways to load data from .csv as explained in YouTube

```{r}
mydf <- read.csv(path2csv, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```
the following are functions which can be used to explore uploaded data frame. Use help function within R to understand the arguments / values required to use respective functions

```{r}
dim() # to have overview of the dataframe (row, column)
```


Data Cleaning & Wrangling using dplyr, tidyr

```{r}
library(dplyr) # required prior to use functions in dplyr package

```

```{r}
#pass your data frame using tbl_df function (e.g., noisedf)

noisedf1 <- tbl_df(noisedf)

#explore as.tibble function as replacement to tbl_df function

#use select() function to select variable (column) of interest within the dataframe

noisepeak <- select(noisedf1, bu, oeltype) #as example

noisemax <- select(noisedf1, bu, oeltype)

noisetwa <- select(noisedf1, bu, oeltype)

#use filter() function to select subset of column

peak_bu <- filter(noisepeak, oeltype == "peak_db")

max_bu < filter(noisepeak, oeltype == "stel_dba")

#break up your dataset into groups of rows based on
#the values of one or more variables. The group_by() function is reponsible for doing this.

group_by(noisedf, oeltype = peak_dB)

summarize(by_bu, mean(oeltype))


```
